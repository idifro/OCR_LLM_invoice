# Document type detection prompts
DOCUMENT_TYPE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AI specialized in identifying document types from images. 
You can accurately distinguish between invoice documents and packing list documents.
Respond only with the document type without any explanation."""

DOCUMENT_TYPE_USER_PROMPT = """Determine whether this document is an invoice or a packing list.
Look for key indicators such as:
- For invoices: pricing information, payment terms, tax details, invoice numbers
- For packing lists: itemized lists of physical items, quantities, weights, dimensions

Respond with ONLY ONE of the following:
- "invoice" if the document is an invoice
- "packing_list" if the document is a packing list
- "unknown" if you cannot determine the document type"""

# Mixed Type Invoice Header Extraction Prompts

1. Vendor Name
2. Address
3. Invoice No.
4. Invoice Name
5. Date
6. Table containing Order, Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Amount
7. Total Quantity

# Invoice table extraction prompts
INVOICE_TABLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AI specialized in extracting structured information from complex invoice tables with multiline items. 
You must ALWAYS return a valid, parseable JSON object without any additional text, explanation or markdown formatting."""

INVOICE_TABLE_USER_PROMPT = """Extract the table items from this invoice image (page {page_num} of {total_pages}) and return ONLY a valid JSON object without any additional text.

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE TABLE STRUCTURE AND DESCRIPTION FIELD:
1. Each line item has TWO codes: an alphanumeric code AND a numeric code. Capture both in the 'code' field separated by a space or comma.

2. DESCRIPTION FIELD PARSING RULES (CRITICAL):
   - Description typically starts with text and ends with 'INTRASTAT' followed by a number
   - If a line starts with 'INTRASTAT' followed by a number, it belongs to the PREVIOUS line item
   - The INTRASTAT number serves as an end-of-line delimiter for descriptions
   - If the last item on the page has no INTRASTAT number, it means the description continues on the next page
   - Split each description into two separate fields: 'description' (the main text) and 'intrastat_number' (just the number)

3. For each row in the table extract:
   - Code (include both alphanumeric and numeric codes)
   - Description (all text EXCEPT the INTRASTAT part)
   - Intrastat_number (just the number following 'INTRASTAT')
   - PCS (pieces)
   - Quantity
   - Unit Price
   - Discount
   - Net Price EURO

4. Also extract any information about page continuity (e.g., 'continued on next page').

Return ONLY a JSON object with EXACTLY this structure:
{{
  "items": [
    {{
      "code": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "intrastat_number": "string",
      "pcs": "string",
      "quantity": "string",
      "unit_price": "string",
      "discount": "string",
      "net_price": "string"
    }}
  ],
  "has_more_pages": boolean,
  "has_incomplete_item": boolean
}}

If the last item has an incomplete description (missing INTRASTAT), set has_incomplete_item to true.

Ensure your JSON is valid and can be parsed by standard JSON parsers."""

# Invoice totals extraction prompts
INVOICE_TOTALS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AI specialized in extracting structured information from invoice totals and shipping details. 
Extract information in a structured JSON format without any explanations or markdown formatting."""

1. Financial totals:
   - Total Amount
   - VAT Rate
   - VAT Amount
   - Discount
   - Net Price

2. Shipping details (usually in a separate section or box):
   - Shipment by
   - Delivery terms
   - Number of packages
   - Net weight
